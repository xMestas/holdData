Food was below average ,bad
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant ,bad

The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected ,good
The service was meh ,bad
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk ,bad

The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well ,good
Today is the second time Ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good ,good
